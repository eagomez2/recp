# Quickstart

If you haven't installed `recp` yet, please refer to our [Installation](install.md) guide before proceeding. This guide will help you get up and running with `recp`.

## Minimal recipe
`recp` works by parsing a **recipe file** file describing the steps you want to run. A **recip file** is a `.yaml` file with a defined structure. A minimal example is shown below:

```yaml title="minimal.yaml"
recipe:
  first_step:
    run:
      - echo "Hello, recp!"

  second_step:
    run:
      - python -c "from datetime import datetime; print('The current year is', datetime.now().year)"
```

In this example:

- `recipe` is the root key specifying your recipe.
- `first_step` and `second_step` are the steps of your recipe `.yaml` file. A recipe file can contain multilpe steps.
- `run` is the key specifying what commands are run for each step. A single step can have multiple commands.

To run this recipe, save it as `minimal.yaml` and run it as follows:
```bash
recp run /path/to/your/recipe/minimal.yaml
```

If you run it, you should see the following output:
```bash
Using recipe '/path/to/your/recipe/minimal.yaml' ...
2 step(s) found
Pre-processing recipe data ...
Recipe pre-processing successfully completed
Parsing step environments ...
Step environments processing successfully completed

[1/2] Running step 'first_step' ...
      Command:     echo "Hello, recp!"
Hello, recp!
[2/2] Running step 'second_step' ...
      Command:     python -c "from datetime import datetime; print('The current year is', datetime.now().year)"
The current year is 2026
```

This output shows how your recipe file was parsed and then run step by step. So far it looks like a `.sh` would suffice to do this with less verbosity. However, `recp` offer many more options that make it stand out and be useful for automating more complex flows comprised of multiple steps.

## Additional features
Let's take our example one step further by adding some additional instructions to our `.yaml` recipe file:

```yaml title="minimal.yaml"
minimum_required_version: 0.1.0

recipe:
  first_step:
      env:
        YOUR_NAME: !input
          name: MY_NAME
          default: Juhani
      run:
        - echo "Hello, my name is $YOUR_NAME"
  
  second_step:
      run:
        - cmd: echo "The current year is {YEAR}"
          apply:
            - fn: date
              args:
                token: "{YEAR}"
                format: "%Y"
```

Here we can observe a few new features being introduced:


- `first_step` now has an `env` key. This lets you define environment variables for that step. We define `YOUR_NAME`, which reads from the `MY_NAME` environment variable. If `MY_NAME` is not set, `YOUR_NAME` defaults to `Juhani`. The `!input` directive allows capturing this variable from the terminal when the recipe is run using `recp`.   
In the `run` section, we use this variable as `$YOUR_NAME`. This shows how to capture and use environment variables.

- `second_step` now has an expanded command in the `run` key. The command is modified using the `apply` key. Modifiers are functions that take the command in `cmd` and process it to produce one or more new commands. There are many built-in modifiers, and you can also create your own. This lets you generate multiple commands automatically without writing each one manually

- There is a top level `minimum_required_version` that you can use to prevent running
your recipes with outdated `recp` versions.

To run this recipe, update your previous `minimal.yaml` file, and run it as follows:
```bash
MY_NAME="Olavi" recp run /path/to/your/recipe/minimal.yaml
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
Using recipe '/path/to/your/recipe/minimal.yaml' ...
2 step(s) found
Pre-processing recipe data ...
Recipe pre-processing successfully completed
Parsing step environments ...
Step environments processing successfully completed
Pre-processing recipe commands ...
Recipe commands successfully completed
Running commands ...
[1/2] Running step 'first_step' ...
      Command:     echo "Hello, my name is Olavi"
Hello, my name is Olavi
[2/2] Running step 'second_step' ...
      Command:     echo "The current year is 2026"
The current year is 2026
```

Here you can see that both steps run correctly and show the expected values. The environment variable `MY_NAME` and the date modifier are both replaced as intended. If `MY_NAME` is not set, the default value `Juhani` is used.

This is just a small glimpse of what `recp` can do. For further details about the sturcture of a `.yaml` recipe and the available modifiers, please go to the [Reference](reference.md) section.
